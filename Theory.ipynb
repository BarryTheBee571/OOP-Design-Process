    "The top-down and bottom-up approaches differ in how they break down tasks when designing a software system in an object-oriented language. The top-down approach starts with a broad view of the system, defining major functionalities before refining them into smaller components. This ensures a clear architectural structure, guiding developers in implementing features step by step. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach begins with smaller, reusable modules, focusing on individual classes and methods before integrating them into a full system. This method is more flexible, allowing developers to refine fundamental components first and gradually build upward. While top-down emphasises high-level planning, bottom-up prioritises modular development, and many projects use a blend of both to balance structure and adaptability."

    "2. **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches** – The top-down approach focuses on planning the system architecture first, refining details later, while the bottom-up approach builds individual components first, integrating them into a full system.
